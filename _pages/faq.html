<p>Below are some of the most frequently asked questions (FAQ) about {{ site.application_name_full }}.</p>

<!-- What is Raivo OTP? -->
{% capture question %}
	What is {{ site.application_name_full }}?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture answer %}
	<p>{{ site.application_name_full }} is a mobile application designed for Apple iPhones and Apple iPads. {{ site.application_name_full }} can be used to secure your online identity. You already have a username and password for various online services. However, your password can be breached, which makes you vulnerable to hacks. To mitigate this risk, security experts came up with a solution called Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).</p>

	<p>MFA comes in many forms, the most common one being a 6-digit code on your phone. Whenever you authenticate to one of your accounts, you have to enter your 6-digit code besides your username and password. The 6-digit code changes every 30 seconds, which is why it can't be easily breached. It increases the cyber resilience of your online identity.</p>

	<p>You can enable MFA in almost every online service. It is generally found on the (security) settings page of the online service. Whenever you enable it, you need to scan a QR-code using {{ site.application_name_full }}. The 6-digit code that changes every 30 seconds is then stored in {{ site.application_name_full }}.</p>

	<p>After enabling MFA for an online service, you have to enter the 6-digit code everytime you authenticate using your username and password. You can find the 6-digit code in {{ site.application_name_full }} at all time.</p>

<!-- What are one-time passwords? -->
{% capture question %}
	What are one-time passwords?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture answer %}
	<p>A one-time password (OTP) is a password that you can have in addition to the username and password you use for online services. As the name states, you can only use an OTP once. Don't worry, the OTP will change every 30 seconds, after which you can use it again. As it changes every 30 seconds, it is difficult for hackers to obtain it. Therefore, using an OTP increases your cyber resilience.</p>

<!-- Are my one-time passwords encrypted? -->
{% capture question %}
	Are my one-time passwords encrypted?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture answer %}
	<p>Yes, all one-time passwords (effectively the seeds) stored in {{ site.application_name_full }} for iOS are encrypted using your encryption (master) password and your PIN code. If you have Apple iCloud synchronisation enabled, your one-time passwords in Apple iCloud are encrypted using your encryption (master) password.</p>
	<p>{{ site.application_name_full }} for MacOS does not store any one-time passwords. It only receives them from {{ site.application_name_full }} for iOS. The connection between {{ site.application_name_full }} for iOS and {{ site.application_name_full }} for MacOS is encrypted using an encryption key that was generated during the installation of {{ site.application_name_full }} for MacOS.</p>
	<p>If you export a ZIP-archive using {{ site.application_name_full }} for iOS, the ZIP-archive is encrypted using your encryption (master) password.</p>

<!-- Is Raivo OTP available for Android or another operating system? -->
{% capture question %}
	Is {{ site.application_name_full }} available for other operating systems?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture answer %}
	<p>{{ site.application_name_full }} is only available for iOS and MacOS. It will not be supported on other operating systems such as Windows or Android. The {{ site.application_name_full }} MacOS application is simply a companion application that receives OTP's when you tap them in {{ site.application_name_full }} for iOS. The MacOS application will never evolve in a fully fledged application as it compromises the security level.</p>

<!-- What is the difference between Apple Handoff and Raivo's MacOS app? -->
{% capture question %}
	What does {{ site.application_name_full }} for MacOS do that Apple Handoff doesn't?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture answer %}
	<p>Apple Handoff has two annoying requirements that {{ site.application_name_full }} for MacOS doesn't have.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Handoff doesn't work without Bluetooth, {{ site.application_name_full }} for MacOS does!</li>
		<li>Handoff doesn't work cross iCloud account, {{ site.application_name_full }} for MacOS does!</li>

		</li>
		<li>
			Choose a strong encryption (master) password and save it in your password manager. Afterwards tap continue.
			<br>
			<small>If you forget this encryption (master) password you will lose access to your OTPs. You don't have to enter it every time you open the app, just during (re)installation.</small>
		</li>
		<li>
			You need to set a PIN code. Afterwards tap continue, confirm your PIN code, and tap continue again.
			<br>
			<small>The PIN code is required everytime you unlock the app.</small>
		</li>
		<li>
			At last, {{ site.application_name_full }} gives you the option to enable biometrical unlock (e.g. FaceID).
			<br>
			<small>By enabling biometrical unlock you don't have to enter your PIN code everytime you open the app.</small>
		</li>
